# TEJ music player
A Simple music player which helps you to make your mood go on with fluency and it's quality. Desgined to learn the android development and it is under the development stage.
 # Great design
 - App uses intense Material design themes along with gradient display to show case the user their songs. The Off-white background just adds the cherry on the visual aids. All credit of icon,image and theme design goes to Sourav Roy :+1:  Thanks!!
 # Sort feature
 - You can reorder your songs according to Names(Alphabetical) or Recently Added(time).
 # Accelerometer senser to change the song on SHAKE
 - App uses the inbuilt the acclerometer sensor in your mobile device to calculate the movement of your mobile device in 3D space and if it displaces more than specific(static) units it will take it as event to change the song. Nice!!!!
 - Feature won't work in your device if you dont have accelerometer sensor.
 # Create your favorite playlist
 - Helps you to make sure you will listen to your favorite songs only when you are not in mood to traverse all the songs in a list.
 # Enjoy the Audio visualizer
 - The audio visualizer adjusts itself with audio(volume) in your device to simulate the animation on the screen. Enjoy the bubbles flowing in the screen.

This app was designed under the guidance of Tanseer Saji ,Android developer Internshala. I would be adding more features to the application over the time.
